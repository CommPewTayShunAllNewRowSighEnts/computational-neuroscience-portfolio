### What is the researcher doing?
- exploring the biological plausibility of performing Bayesian computations in the brain using a spiking neural model.
- addressing the issue of representing probability distributions using neural circuits and combining them in meaningful ways to perform inference.
- demonstrating that life span inference task of this model matches human performance better than an ideal Bayesian model due to the use of neuron tuning curves.

### Why did they do it that way?

#### Life Span Prediction Task
- Griffiths and Tenenbaum (2006) evaluate how cognitive judgments compare with optimal statistical inference by asking people to predict human life spans.


### What are other ways of doing it?

### How is it useful to me?
- using this to make decisions/select actions using information theoretic objective functions. 
- applying this model to other tasks where humans show poor judgement of bayesian priors.

# Generalizable knowledge outweighs incidental details in prefrontal ensemble code over time


## Paper Review 
**Paper**: [Morrissey, M. D. (2017)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/22177)

### What question are they trying to answer?
- how do memories and learning generalize? 
- how do network-level processes develop knowledge structure of the world that can be applied to new experiences?

### What is the researcher doing?
- They show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, 
  1. neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, 
  2. with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. 
- They further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features **immediately generalized to the new situation**. 

### Why did they do it that way?

### What are other ways of doing it?

### How is it useful to me?
- Memories for recent experiences are rich in incidental detail, but with time the brain is thought to extract latent rules and structures common across past experiences.
- If this could be modelled with Nengo it could provide interesting insights into how learning and long-term memories are formed, however I think replicating these results in Nengo would be challenging.
- This potentially provides interesting insights into how memories can be consolidated
  - could we model something with Nengo that responds the same way to different stimuli? Auditory and visual?

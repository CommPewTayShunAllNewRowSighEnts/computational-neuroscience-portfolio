## Paper Review 

**Paper:** [Tyng, C. M. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01454)

### What questions are the researchers trying to answer?
- The aim of this current article was to highlight an evolutionary approach to emotion, which may facilitate understanding of the effects of emotion on learning and memory. 

### What is the researcher doing?
#### Presents the terminology used in affective neuroscience studies
Emotions describe a complex set of interactions between subjective and objective variables that are mediated by neural and hormonal systems, which can:
1. give rise to affective experiences of emotional valence (pleasure-displeasure) and emotional arousal (high-low activation/calming-arousing);
2. generate cognitive processes such as emotionally relevant perceptual affect, appraisals, labeling processes; 
3. activate widespread psychological and physiological changes to the arousing conditions; and 
4. motivate behavior that is often but not always expressive, goal-directed and adaptive.

#### Describes the **roles of emotion and motivation in learning and memory** and outlines the evolutionary framework and the **seven primary emotional system** 
According to Panksepp (1998) the above definition does not encompass some important aspects of emotional systems such as how emotions operate to create subjectively experienced feelings and how they control personality dimensions. 
  - each emotion has a characteristic “feeling tone” that is especially important in encoding the intrinsic values of these interactions, depending on their likelihood of either promoting or hindering survival (both in the immediate “personal” and long-term “reproductive” sense). 
  - Subjective experiential-feelings arise from the interactions of various emotional systems with the fundamental brain substrates of “the self,” that is important in **encoding new information** as well as **retrieving information** on subsequent events and **allowing individuals efficiently to generalize new events and make decisions**.
He went further to propose seven primary emotional systems/prototype emotional states, namely: 
  - SEEKING 
  - RAGE
  - FEAR 
  - LUST 
  - CARE
  - PANIC/GRIEF and 
  - PLAY 
that represent basic foundations for living and learning.

It is well established that emotions influence memory retention and recall, in terms of learning, the question of emotional impacts remains questionable. 
 
Confounding influences of emotions on learning and memory can be explained in terms of attentional and motivational components. 
- Attentional components enhance perceptual processing, which then helps to select and organize salient information via a “bottom-up” approach to higher brain functions and awareness.[Vuilleumier2005] 
- Motivational components induce curiosity, which is a state associated with psychological interest in novel and/or surprising activities (stimuli). 
    - A curiosity state encourages further exploration and apparently prepares the brain to learn and remember in both children and adults.[Oudeyer2016] 
    - The term “surprising” might be conceptualized as an incongruous situation (expectancy violation) refers to a **discrepancy between prior expectations and the new information**; it may drive a **cognitive reset for “learned content” that draws one’s attention**.

**Emotionally enhanced memory functions** have been reported in relation to **selective attention** elicited by **emotionally salient stimuli** [Vuilleumier2005];[Schupp2007]
During the initial perceptual stage, attention is biased toward emotionally salient information that supports detection by the salient input. Thus, stimulating selective attention increases the likelihood for emotional information to become encoded in LTM storage associated with a top-down control in sensory pathways that are modulated by the frontal and parietal cortices. 
This is an example of an indirect influence on perception and attention that regulates selective sensory processing and behavioral determination.


#### Outlines emotional-cognitive interactions in the various brain regions that are intimately involved in **emotion and memory systems**
Because the human sensory systems have no capacity to simultaneously process everything at once, which necessitates attentional mechanisms. 
- Top-down attentional processing obtains adequate attentional resource allocation to process emotional valence information for encoding and retrieval via cooperation with the brain regions such as the
  - ventromedial prefrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus, 
  - along with the primary visual cortex (helps to realize both emotion and conceptualization).
 
- **This is performed to define the congruent interactions in these regions are associated with long-term memory (LTM) retention.**
- discuss the emerging studies that further our understanding of emotional effects deriving from different modalities of emotional content.
- discusses four major functional neuroimaging techniques, including 
  - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
  - positron emission tomography (PET) 
  - electroencephalography (EEG), and 
  - functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
- presents the **important factors for consideration in experimental design**
- describe psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, which are emotionally charged dysfunctions that are strongly detrimental to cognitive performance
- remarks on the current issues and future research possibilities with respect to the efficient enhancement of educational practices and technologies

### Why did they do it that way?
- this was a very interesting review paper on a subject that could be quite impactful, there are no experiments here though.

### What are other ways of doing it?
According to Tyng several remaining questions should be addressed in future studies, including:
  1. the **impact of emotion on semantic knowledge encoding and retrieval** 
  2. psychological and physiological changes associated with semantic learning and memory, 
  3. the development of methods that incorporate emotional and motivational aspects that improve educational praxes, outcomes, and instruments. 

### How is it useful to me?
- Emotion has a substantial influence on the cognitive processes in humans, including perception, attention, **learning**, **memory**, reasoning, and **problem-solving**. 
  - I would like to see the impact of incorporating emotional states on these cognitive processes
  - Emotion has a particularly strong influence on attention, 
    - especially modulating the selectivity of attention 
    - as well as motivating action and behavior. 
    - This attentional and executive control is intimately linked to **learning processes**, 
      - as intrinsically limited attentional capacities are better focused on relevant information.
      - **can we use emotional states to influence where a robot directs its attention?**
  - Emotion also facilitates encoding and helps retrieval of information efficiently.
    - **How can we model this with Nengo?**
  - the effects of emotion on learning and memory are not always univalent, 
    - studies have reported that emotion either enhances or impairs learning and long-term memory (LTM) retention, depending on a range of factors.
      - **Can this be replicated in simulation?**
  - Recent neuroimaging findings have indicated that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex cooperate with the medial temporal lobe in an integrated manner that affords 
    1. the amygdala modulating memory consolidation; 
    2. the prefrontal cortex mediating memory encoding and formation; and 
    3. the hippocampus for successful learning and LTM retention.
- Emotional experiences/stimuli appear to be remembered vividly and accurately, with great resilience over time.
- Three different approaches are used to monitor the changes in emotional states: 
   1. ~~subjective approaches that assess subjective feelings and experiences;~~ *unfortunately I cannot know the subjective experience of a robot*
   2. behavioral investigations of 
      1. facial expressions (Jack and Schyns, 2015), 
      2. vocal expressions (Russell et al., 2003), and 
      3. gestural changes (Dael et al., 2012); and 
   3. objective approaches via physiological responses that include 
      1. electrical and hemodynamic of the central nervous system (CNS) activities (Vytal and Hamann, 2010) - *could be incorporated into a spiking NN*
      2. in addition to autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses such as 
         1. heart rate, 
         2. respiratory volume/rate, 
         3. skin temperature, 
         4. skin conductance and 
         5. blood volume pulses (Li and Chen, 2006).
- it describes the roles of emotion and motivation in learning and memory, 
- it outlines the **seven primary emotional system**
- outlines emotional-cognitive interactions in the various brain regions that are intimately involved in emotion and memory systems
  - **This is performed to define the congruent interactions in these regions are associated with long-term memory (LTM) retention.**
- Substantial evidence has established that emotional events are remembered more clearly, accurately and for longer periods of time than are neutral events.
  - If this can be replicated in simulation it would provide a lot of value to the pursuit of AGI
- activation of the amygdala:
  - enhances the processing of emotionally arousing stimuli 
  - modulates enhanced memory consolidation along with other memory-related brain regions, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, MTL, as well as the visual, frontal and parietal cortices.
- activation of the PFC 
  - enhances cognitive functions, such as strategic and semantic processing that affect WM and also promote the establishment of LTM.
- Previous studies have primarily used standardized emotional visual, or auditory stimuli such as pictures, words, facial expression, and film clips, often based on the IAPS, ANEW, and POFA databases for emotional pictures, words and facial expressions, respectively.
  - **What standardized data could we use in simulation?**
- the SEEKING system generates positive subjective emotional states-positive expectancy, enthusiastic exploration, and hopefulness, apparently, initiates learning and memory in the brain. **wow!**
- **All cognitive activity is motivated from ‘underneath’ by basic emotional and homeostatic needs (motivational drives) that explore environmental events for survival while facilitating secondary processes of learning and memory.**

#### Many opportunities for study: 
- To their knowledge, there are few objective studies that employed brain-mapping techniques to examine semantic memory of learning materials (using subject matter) in the education context. 
- influences derived from emotional factors in human learning and memory remains unclear as to whether positive emotions facilitate learning or negative emotions impair learning and vice versa.
